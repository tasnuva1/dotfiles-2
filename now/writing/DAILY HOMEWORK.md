- What I'm afrate of?
	- big mass if he knows tahsin fee. we shouldn't go to resturant, so that mom doen't have to ask him for extra money.
	- and I shouldn't ask him for monitor. You have to work on the bare minimam. Unitl you learn How to build stuff. and show it to the world. 12 weeks I need. Every day of the week, 12 hours of studying and building. and 2 hours for waching a siries. After 2 weeks last 2 days, apply for the jobs. so I have **12 days** for complition. and 12 hours of studing, impimanting.

I have be better. I should start form "not speaking loundly".

I agrey case in every tasks there is no reqularity. `For that 9:40 pm to 05:00 am sleep. rotine wise, 10 am I'll go to nanu's house to 10:00 pm. A small help for chalamuni if can.`

- It should be easy. Why I am doing what I should do, Why I going back to youtube and clicking things. Because it's easy. You have to put the same constration there as well. Going into, taking the first step is so easy. 
- And in the process it should be feel good.

Reminders:
- Not just make it work, the enginnering side of it.
- Building small thing, commiting, Your commit should do 1 small thing.
- Constantly learning excessive languages.
- Don't do too many things at onece. " I'm currently in the middle of something, let me get this done first. and then move on. " Bing done is the engine of more. Completing is a way to get other things done and move on.
- Not knowing, action, completion. By the action, you will know something. Not other way around.
- Have critiques. Strangely we want them to praise our super complex and unmaintainable code.

I don't want it to do something when I don't know execly how to done that, for doing that it should be simple.

- basically I need setup to support for **all kinds of software** for **all kinds of features** to make life easyer, simpler and firster for takaling other problems. More Ditails: setup with windows application and minimal linux but modan feature like terminal with font and great fast for opening task. and auto start processes support like different package managers.
	- kowing how different package manager, different hiperviser works, how linux works.
	- bios course
- buying a waking shose and **waking** with it every sigle day in morning.
- in the pc, usb all the time working **speaker**.
- for nanu, that nasid writing and priting.

There are lots of things, theory to learn. When I learn a lot of theory, I don't know how to use it. 
But when I try to use it, in the context of making a specific project, I feel like I don't know this theory, case there is a lot of it, to learn.
Theory learn it in a way that I can come back to it.

Others:
1. Read the book twites
2. katals, practices by projects or small parctices, redo every week, moving fast and bracking thing is the best way to develop. (Book side by side.)
3. Haskell

2. Rust Destop application building. 3/10

**[If you can use it, you can make it, it's nothing special]**

you can watch some yt videos if you're completely new to the **blockchain structure**. It's just a **linked list**, nothing special. The hard part comes about building production-ready code. Firstly you need to choose between Proof of Work and Proof of Stack (it better be the second one) and then I would try to read and understand the code of some existing projects

**Here's my newbie realization of PoW: https://github.com/frolvanya/blockchain**

**And here's a full blockchain PoS ecosystem built on Rust called NEAR protocol: https://github.com/near/nearcore**

Proper scalability is still a current research topic, but **you can just look at popular **chain implementations** to get started.** **its for building block library ==https://github.com/darkrenaissance/darkfi== **

That said, most of the actual performance issues you run into have more to do with the **nature of distributed systems** than the language you use to implement them.

Along the way, getting that outcome you can insert some knowledge or go in-dethp about it.******** (don't take longer puses to learn a thing, write the crappy code then understand the meaning behind it. in the end you have the code. then go learn to improve that code)
Or First having the knowledge then outcome. I don't have the energy or the flow, or I can't just follow the rule, have to know the perpose.

what is outcome? my own peace of code. [**************solving chalenges by sudo code**************]
anything that is not problem sloving that is knowledge.

Steps:
1. look at the daiagram then asks solving chanenges by sudo code? which one is it?

Conclution:
1. I'm gonna start with solving chanengles.[is there any change of solving chanengles by sudo code? (a small product that I can use?)] [if muliple option - am I gonna have my own peace of code? which one is the most clearest answer?]

**For becoming a good developer:**
1. coding everyday, work on more projects. the more you do the coding side of it, the butter it is.
2. book and documentation are for advence. tutorial are for beginners. 
3. contribute to open source project.
4. you need to read the code as much as you can. more you read more you understand.

When I will be satisfied in my day? 
Ans: I want it to do which are only few people can do like building protocals, hug project.learn and create products for others to use and for others to contribute. Building interesting stuff that picks intrest, for you and other people to use. For writting as many code as possiable like the open source developer writes **in 1 setting or in one go, to get something to work.** Don't need to understand code first, First Building logic, translates to code. A better developer You will understand later, first learn to use it. : once you find out the niess stay loyal to it. prjects like web sockets, core utilitys in deep implementation or use, *by* learning about the open project or a startup, or s manafessted into learning different framwork, core tools -> skill development. 

*By* seen and understood the project structure or the methods. How: Focus on the api side, api intergration will help in how the application is communicating with other things, other services, or micro services like one feature that is communicating with another feature. in this way, you know, how the api is intergrating with another feature. How this cli command is approaching to another functionality. How this public/internal interface is integrating with another public/internal interface. how this interface is linked to that feature.

*by* this, it will develop a structure or chain in you're mind. That how this application is working. 

So focus on interface structure. how command or the buttons are communicating with each other.

Now you can relate to the problems/issues that are present.


Project finding for to understand:
1. Find that whether the tech stack is match of you'r learning or learned.
2. software you're using. (is this software used in the industryal level, economic, trade, startup useage)
3. or Software you like, problems they are tring to slove.
4. Active communities: present in slack channel or Discord server and communication gap bettween messages. yesterday or 2 days before or 1 week or 2 month.
5. or go to other channels or issues or PRs for how the maintainers are talking to the contributors. Helpfull, or not providing the resources, or not.

so, using it, liking it. tech stack is matching, community is active.

How to contribute:
1. Don't go to the issue.
2. Proper way understanding the project: 
1. see the project as a client.  What are the problem they are solving and what is remaining to solve.
2. developer mindset, thing that are not working, problems. problems are maintioned or not.
project structure or the methods are clearly maintioned or not.

How to send a PR: *by* ... see up.

there are giving you response for the sake of the project without paid. Just solve the problems on your own. Don't bother too much. Don't ask many questions.

Object upon the bottom of my car, but wanting to make the track I willed myself to ignore it (as if that would make it vanish) even though I began to smell gasoline.   I checked the gas gauage and it seemed to be holding...it had been a terrible week already but, you know, Defeat can strengthen just as victory can weaken.


I let them have their little victories which they need far more than I do.

Figuring if I got famous too early, I wouldn't have anything left for the stretch run. learning new thing, extral drive to do even bigger thing.

Armbands do not ornament a person, nor does a necklace bright as the moon. Not bath-oil, ointment, flower petals, elaborate hair. Only speech, measured and precise, gives distinction. Cosmetics fade or fatique. true speech is the true adornment.

In the old days brave generous folk brought forth the world we know. Some nurtured the land, others conquered and handed it out like straw husks. There are still poeple who govern incorruptibly in all the four directions, but this cankerout pride what is it crippling men who rule the tiniest village?

If I crush gravel hard enough I might extract sesame oil. Thirsty enough I could draw water out of a desert mirage. Someday I will travel far & locate the legendary rabbit-hole But to appease the mind of a fool, that's beyond me.

At night a mouse chewed a hole in a wicker basket. It dropped into the jaws of a snake crammed inside, weak with hunger, restored by the creature's flesh the snake slipped free through the little hole. Stay within yourself. Fate acts; no one can see what makes a person rise or fall.

When health's intact, you're at home in your body and old age looks far off. While your senses are sharp. your desires potent, the life force hasn't withered, that's when the wise make their spirits great. Who digs a well, with their house already in flames?

Infrastructure and cloud, Development tools, Operating systems (lot of things to learn)

My todo's:
- finding project is done. (infrastructure project)
- I can undersand the rust code base, not, ditals, just all it parts which connect to others. issue go dital into that part
- undersand the code base and it's parts which connects to others. (all best projects bare minimam korbo) (I'm in a bussiness it's like, all of the projects)
- I have to solve the distributated scalibility application building problem, have to solve the large scale problem.

everything is just a wraper to interact with. How many wraper you can learn in a day, that's the question How fast you can learn the wraper to make something usefull. 

which project to do first? where I can do contribution faster, where I can prossec faster. understand faster. the one I can process faster. which data I can process faster, be lazy, no manual work.

1st your conpects, like asy programming. 2nd thing you need is to have the experience and the confidence to build production grade rust software. You deploy somewhere that other people use. Somthing that you can put on your resume to get the inteview in the first place. and thrid thing you need is to have the right connections. This inculdes having a community of rust enthusiasts and experts, having access to rust recruiters who can advocate for you, and knowing developer who already have a rust role.

Along the way, getting that outcome / my own peace of code you can insert some knowledge or go in-dethp about how they do it, the solution.
(Don't take longer puses to learn a thing. Write the crappy code then understand the meaning behind it. 
In the end you have the code. then go learn to improve that code. about the indivicual paces go to a course)
(What they do, How they work, How they do certen things & what are the disadvantage & advantage)

what is outcome? my own peace of code. [**************solving chalenges by sudo code**************]
Steps:
1. look at the daiagram then asks solving chanenges by sudo code? which one is it?

After the courses, What you are learning in the course, go to *popular project try to solve the issues. Improve the project by the disadvantages. (For that see the disadvantage & advantage to make sense the issues, figure out solution with research.)

Unimportent Side Through:
Or First having the knowledge then outcome. I don't have the energy or the flow, or I can't just follow the rule, have to know the perpose / outcome.

---
you are a creator and a designer & in this world you have to create stuffs because you have limited number of resources and limited usefullness. So need to know what to use, what solution to use. To learn that go to a course for solutions. keep in mind, most of the leaning will happen while solving coding challenges by solutions.  

Unimportent Side Through:
FAANG companies ask more difficult questions compared to startups.
For sinior roles experience & system design matter then leetcode.
- What is one thing knowing which made everything else easier?
- Example solution like 1st time binary search 30m, 2nd time it's half 15m, 3rd time 10m, 4th time 8m, 5th 5m, 10th 30s it's like 1 2 3. (steps)
800-900 problems to 200 really, wow level difficult problems. (why it works? math proofs on the paper doing it so many times boring repetition, that's the math class)
